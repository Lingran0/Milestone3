## Features

This project provides the following functionalities:

1. **Remove Stop Words**: Filters out common stop words to focus on meaningful text.
2. **Calculate Basic Statistics**:
   - Total word count.
   - Total sentence count.
3. **Sort Words by Frequency**: Lists words sorted by their frequency of occurrence.
4. **Calculate Vocabulary Richness**: Measures the uniqueness of the text by counting unique words.
5. **Find Most Repeated Words**: Identifies the top three most frequently occurring words.
6. **Determine Sentiment**:
   - Calculates a sentiment score based on positive and negative word counts.
   - Outputs a sentiment classification (positive, negative, or neutral).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

1. **`main.main`**:  
   The entry point of the program.  
   - Provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
   - Handles inputs, error messages, and controls the flow of the application.

2. **`textProcessor.textProcessor`**:  
   Responsible for text-related preprocessing tasks.  
   - Reads text files from the system.
   - Removes stop words using a predefined stop word file.

3. **`statisticCalculator.statisticCalculator`**:  
   Performs all statistical computations, word frequency ranking, and sentiment analysis.  
   - Calculates word and sentence counts.
   - Generates word frequency maps.
   - Evaluates vocabulary richness and sentiment scores.
