\f1\i0\b0\fs34\fsmilli17250 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 British dogs and cats are set to become the first animals in Europe to chow down on meat cultivated from chicken cells.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa225\partightenfactor0

\fs30 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Britain has approved the sale of lab-grown meat for pet food, becoming the first European nation to give its blessing to a process that has prompted opposition in other countries.\
The move, which became an opportunity for entrepreneurs after Britain\'92s split from the more-regulated European Union, is a victory for the biotech industry, which the British government hopes to build into a\cf5 \'a0\strokec6 superpower\strokec4 .\
The landmark approval went to\'a0\strokec6 Meatly\strokec4 , a British company that grows meat from chicken cells for pet food. Its product, which will begin feeding trials in August, arrives at a time when the\'a0\strokec6 worldwide market for pet food\strokec4 \'a0is expected to grow 5 percent this year to $151 billion, according to the research firm Sta\cf4 tista.\
And it is more sustainable and kinder to animals, said Owen Ensor, the chief executive of Meatly.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \'93It allows you to still feed the meat that your pets crave and that you want to feed your pet \'97 while providing all the nutrients that your pet needs,\'94 said Mr. Ensor, who added that he had fed the product to his cats, Lamu and Zanzi.\
\
When it comes to lab-grown meat, Britain is ahead of countries in the European Union primarily because it is no longer beholden to the bloc\'92s tighter regulations and often slow-moving approval process for technological developments, advocates of alternative proteins said.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa225\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \'93Europe is cutting itself off from innovation,\'94 said Linus Pardoe, the U.K. policy manager at the Good Food Institute Europe, which works to advance technological alternatives to animal proteins. \'93The U.K. has a much more straightforward system now that we\'92ve left the European Union.\'94\
That has been wielded as a political win for Brexit fans, said Tom MacMillan, the chair of rural policy and strategy at the Royal Agricultural University, who has\'a0\cf5 \strokec6 studied farmer perceptions of lab-based meat\cf4 \strokec4 .\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \'93The last government had a bit of an exercise of hunting around for dividends for Brexit,\'94 he said, adding that food regulations were one of the few areas in which Britain and the European Union might be able to diverge.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa225\partightenfactor0
\cf4 And many of the top British science universities are used to working closely with the country\'92s biotech companies, Mr. Pardoe said. \'93The U.K. has got a big scientific brain that it can apply to developing and scaling cultivated meat,\'94 he said.\cf4 \cb1 \strokec4 \
\cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Advocates said the shift would have climate benefits. Farming is a\cf5 \'a0\strokec6 major source of pollution\strokec4 \'a0and requires an enormous amount of water and land use.\cb1 \strokec4 \
\cb3 \strokec4 \'93We also need to be considering the environmental impacts of pets,\'94 said Andrew Knight, a veterinary professor affiliated with Murdoch University School of Veterinary Medicine in Australia and an expert on the sustainable pet food sector.\cb1 \strokec4 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf5 \cb3 \strokec4 Various studies, he said, show \'93that a medium-sized dog has a dietary paw print that is equivalent to that of an average person.\'94 In 2020, dogs and cats in the United States consumed an average of 20 percent of all the livestock bred for consumption in the country, according to his\'a0\cb3 \strokec6 research\cb3 \strokec4 . Globally, dogs and cats ate abo\cf4 ut 9 percent in 2018.\cf4 \cb1 \strokec4 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa225\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Entrepreneurs say they can solve what is sometimes called \'93the animal-lovers paradox\'94 \'97 people love their pets, but do not want a chicken to die in a factory farm to feed them.\
\'93We don\'92t need to raise or kill any animals,\'94 Mr. Ensor said, laying out the vision for Meatly, which got its cells from a single chicken egg. \'93Instead of 50 billion chickens a year, it\'92s one egg, one time, and we\'92ve created an infinite amount of meat.\'94\
But lab-grown meat and other alternative proteins (along with\cf5 \'a0\cb3 \strokec6 oat, soy and almond milks\cb3 \strokec4 ) have become a political football in both Europe and the United States.\
Italy, a gastronomic tinderbox,\'a0\cb3 \strokec6 banned\cb3 \strokec4 \'a0the sale of cell-cultivated meat last year, as right-wing lawmakers argued that they were protecting the country\'92s farmers and national heritage. France is trying to\'a0\cb3 \strokec6 police the language around lab-grown meat,\cb3 \strokec4 \'a0banning what it calls \'93foodstuffs containing vegetable proteins\'94 from being labeled \'93filet\'94 or \'93steak,\'94 among others;\'a0\cb3 \strokec6 Austria\cb3 \strokec4 \'a0and\'a0\cb3 \strokec6 Hungary\cb3 \strokec4 \'a0are holding similar debates.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf5 In the United States,\'a0\cb3 \strokec6 lab-grown meat\cb3 \strokec4 \'a0has become a temperature check for both the right and the left. Florida\'a0\cb3 \strokec6 banned the food\cb3 \strokec4 \'a0in May after two California companies\'a0\cb3 \strokec6 received approval\cb3 \strokec4 \'a0to start selling their meat last year.\cf4 \

\f1 \AppleTypeServices \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Britain, notably, has not yet approved the meat for human consumption.\
That\'92s partly because of regulatory challenges \'97 and partly because it may not pass a national ick-test: A\'a0\cf5 \cb3 \strokec6 study\cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0in 2022 by the University of Winchester found that about 40 percent of meat-eaters would be willing to try cultivated meat. But about 81 percent of them would feed it to their pets.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf4 To Meatly, that\'92s good news for its product. \'93Pet food allows us to sidestep some of those issues,\'94 Mr. Ensor said.\
