\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 How Aston Martin F1 won the race for Adrian Newey, the sport\'92s most coveted mind\
\pard\pardeftab720\li620\fi-620\ri620\sa400\partightenfactor0

\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 As outgoing Red Bull chief technical officer Adrian Newey took to the stage, Stroll met his gaze, shook his hand, and drew him in for an embrace. They\'92d been in the same circles for decades, on opposing teams in the\'a0\cf4 \strokec5 F1\cf2 \strokec2 \'a0paddock for nearly 10 years, and shared many gyms in hotels worldwide.\
\'93He was on the bike, and I was on the treadmill behind him, trying to catch up with him!\'94 Stroll joked.\
Now, Stroll had caught him.\
From Mar. 1 next year, Newey, the most successful designer in F1 history, will don Aston Martin green and put his prowess behind the push to create the next great F1 team. He will become a shareholder in the team and take on the role of managing technical partner in a deal that will make Newey one of the highest earners in British sport.\
Stroll hailed it as \'93the most exciting news in our Aston Martin Formula One history, and probably the most exciting news in Formula One in general.\'94 He called Newey \'93a gentleman and a winner.\'94\
The latest \'97 and arguably most significant \'97 part of Stroll\'92s master plan had arrived. A major statement of intent. And for Newey, the start of the next chapter in a glittering F1 career.\

\f1\b \cf2 The race for Newey\'92s signature\
\pard\pardeftab720\li620\fi-620\ri620\sa400\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 During\'a0\cf4 \strokec5 a turbulent start\cf2 \strokec2 \'a0to Red Bull\'92s season, Newey\'92s decision to leave, made over the Japanese Grand Prix weekend, was a big shock.\
Not long after it first emerged he was seeking to leave, Red Bull confirmed his exit after agreeing on the terms of his release. He\'92d focus on delivering Red Bull\'92s no-rules hypercar,\'a0\cf4 \strokec5 the RB17\cf2 \strokec2 , for the remainder of his time at the team before leaving in the first quarter of 2025. There\'92d be no gardening leave to follow; he\'92d be a free agent.\
That detail quickly sparked interest from across the F1 grid. Every team knew just what an asset Newey could be to their design groups and, more importantly, the message it would send to their rivals. Newey admitted in Tuesday\'92s news conference that he was \'93very flattered to have a lot of approaches from various teams.\'94\
\
\'93I believe this is meant to be,\'94 Stroll said.\
Moving to McLaren or Williams would have been romantic, given that Newey won his first two championships with them. Williams team principal James Vowles was candid about his interest in Newey. McLaren remained coy\'97yes, someone like him would appeal, but the team has firm confidence in its existing technical group, which has propelled it into 2024\'92s championship fight.\
Ferrari was the most conspicuous link for Newey. He\'92d come close in the past to moving to Maranello, only to decide to remain with Red Bull each time. For a team that had already made a statement by\'a0\cf4 \strokec5 signing Lewis Hamilton for 2025\cf2 \strokec2 , and with Hamilton supportive of a move, Newey would surely be a sign that Ferrari meant business. In Miami, one F1 team principal, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, \'93That\'92s where I\'92d put my money right now.\'94\
But a few weeks later, around Monaco, Ferrari\'92s interest had cooled. The numbers floating around about Newey\'92s salary were creeping higher, with multiple paddock sources putting it north of \'a325 million ($32.7 million) per year. Although such a figure would be exempt from the budget cap, given the top three earners are outside of it, it would still require a significant outlay for any team to justify.\
Newey himself was in zero rush to make a decision. He was enjoying a bit of time away from the F1 race track. At Goodwood in June, for the launch of the RB17, he told\'a0
\f2\i \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 The Athletic:\'a0
\f0\i0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'93I just need to take a bit of time out and then go from there.\'94\
Even if Newey was relaxed about what might come next, by late June, Aston Martin already looked like his most likely destination.\
\'93In the end, it became a very clear and natural choice,\'94 Newey said on Tuesday.\

\f1\b \cf2 The June factory visit\
\pard\pardeftab720\li620\fi-620\ri620\sa400\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 To sell Aston Martin to the greatest designer in F1 history, one would need to go beyond simply pointing to its on-track performances, particularly in 2024.\
Aston Martin was the breakout team in early 2023, running as the second-fastest team behind Red Bull. Alonso was a podium regular, immediately justifying his decision to join the team, and\'a0\cf4 \strokec5 came within one correct pit call\cf2 \strokec2 \'a0of winning the Monaco Grand Prix. But as the year wore on, it couldn\'92t keep up with the rate of development, causing it to slump to fifth in the final standings. 2024 offered more of the same. Alonso and Stroll haven\'92t finished a race any higher than fifth and are confined to scrapping for occasional points.\
\pard\pardeftab720\li620\fi-620\ri620\sa400\partightenfactor0
\cf2 The goal has always been the long-term for Aston Martin. As of 2026, it will become Honda\'92s works team, a status most perceive as a major advantage under the overhauled technical regulations when integrating the new power units into the cars. The first phase of its state-of-the-art factory at Silverstone opened last year, and its new, in-house wind tunnel is set to enter operation in 2025 \'96 an important step for any team with championship aspirations.\
Aston Martin was eager to show Newey what it was putting together at Silverstone, paving the way for a secret visit to the factory in June. Stroll said this was a \'93critically important\'94 moment to give Newey a visual representation of the team\'92s project and ambition.\
\'93The combination of seeing all the facilities, how nice a feel and how well thought out the building is, and perhaps most of all, that very visual demonstration,\'94 Newey said. \'93If I had to describe Lawrence in one sentence, (I\'92d say) he has total belief, he has a direction, and he\'92s happy to be put all his chips on black, and that\'92s what he\'92s done.\'94\
\'93In this case,\'94 Stroll chipped in, \'93green.\'94\
Convinced by Stroll\'92s plan, the summer proved busier than Newey would have liked as they neared an agreement on terms before the deal was finalized last week. He plans to take some holiday with his wife, Mandy, to recharge before seeing out his time with Red Bull and starting the new challenge next year.\

\f1\b \cf2 A long-awaited union with Alonso\
\pard\pardeftab720\li620\fi-620\ri620\sa400\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 For Newey, the move also allows him to remedy what he has previously referred to as one of his great career regrets: never working with Alonso.\
Alonso has always held Newey in high regard. He recently received an Aston Martin Valkyrie, the hypercar Newey designed when Red Bull partnered with the British manufacturer. Until recent months, that would have been the only Newey-designed car Alonso would have had the pleasure of driving. Now under contract until at least the end of 2026 and envisioning a relationship with Aston Martin that reaches beyond his driving career, Alonso will finally get to see first-hand how Newey\'92s mind works and benefit from his input.\
\'93We\'92ve battled against each other for so many years, he\'92s been a bit of an arch-enemy at times,\'94 Newey joked. \'93And we came so close to him joining Red Bull for 2009, but unfortunately, it didn\'92t quite happen. We continued to battle against each other. He\'92s a legend of the sport. Very much looking forward to working with him.\'94\
Alonso referred to Newey as an \'93inspiration\'94 for their battles over the years. \'93Thanks to Adrian and his talent and his cars, I think we all got better as drivers, as engineers, as teams,\'94 Alonso said. \'93We all had to raise the bar, thanks to him, to be able to compete. It\'92s an incredible day for the team.\'94
