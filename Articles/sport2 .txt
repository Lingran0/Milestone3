\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Only three months ago, with Paris preparing to host the\'a0\cf4 \cb3 \strokec5 Olympics\cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0and Paralympics, France was in political disarray.\
President Emmanuel Macron had called a snap election after the National Rally\'92s victory in the European elections, and France football captain\cf4 \'a0\cb3 \strokec5 Kylian Mbappe said before football\'92s European\ul  Championship\cf2 \cb3 \ulnone \strokec2 \'a0that \'93the extremes are knocking on the doors of power\'94 and urged young people to \'93make a difference\'94.\
There was uncertainty and concern, which was not eased by the election ending in a political stalemate with no majority.\
Many Parisians\'a0
\f1\i \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 The Athletic
\f0\i0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0has spoken to over the past 12 days thought the Games would be a disaster but Olympic fever gripped the city with packed stadiums and fan zones. People were happy, the organisation was slick and French stars, including\'a0\cf4 \cb3 \strokec5 Leon Marchand\cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 , were born.\
\'93I\'92ve never seen so many people smile on the metro,\'94 said Kumcu, who knew Paris seemed different \'97 more tourists, fewer locals \'97 when someone said sorry for bumping into her.\
Tourists provided incredible business for restaurants, though one Uber driver was disappointed as he was expecting more people. The consensus, however, was the Olympics were a great success.\
But what lay in store for the Paralympics? Would people get involved and how would Paris cope with locals, who often leave the city during the summer, returning from their travels?\
\'93We must make these Paralympic Games as successful as the Olympics,\'94 Valerie Pecresse,\'a0\cf4 \cb3 \strokec5 the president of the Ile-de-France region, in which the country\'92s capital lies, posted on X\cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0two days before the opening ceremony.\
\'93Efficient management of traffic flows, increased services, free shuttles and dedicated minibuses for people with disabilities, a stronger human presence\'85 everything will be done to make sure we\'92re there for the event!\'94\
Paris was hosting the Paralympics for the first time and the locals were curious. A week before it started, more than 1.75million tickets had been sold, 92 per cent of them to French people. Some Parisians bought tickets either side of the Olympics, while some, such as students Naik De Berri and Oceane Ansah, who received free tickets, only decided a week before to watch France in wheelchair fencing and basketball.\
Another supporter, Thomas Hernandez, who experienced the Olympics, wanted to \'93continue the magic\'94. The Paralympics offered another opportunity to celebrate.\
\'93We might as well make the most of it because we won\'92t be seeing the Games again so soon,\'94 said Hernandez.\
His friend Rodolphe Fourgeot bought tickets to eight events as he wanted to see different sports at iconic venues. He expected Paris to deliver a Paralympics with the same high standards so that the \'93party goes on\'94.\
\'93There was a break and now we\'92re back,\'94 he said. Adverts on the metro read: \'93The game is not over.\'94\
\'93I\'92ve seen everyone smiling again, on the metro, in restaurants \'97 even though there\'92s no government,\'94 said Games volunteer Zakiri, dressed in his green uniform, before the opening ceremony.\
\'93We\'92re not talking politics: we\'92re talking sport and joy. It\'92s an enchanted interlude for us. The Paralympic athletes are in the limelight, we\'92re putting politics aside.\'94\
There was also hope that the Paralympics could, in Fourgeot\'92s words, \'93change the way society looks at people with disabilities and show them in performance-based light, their best light\'94.\
The Paris Paralympic Games sold 2.4million tickets, second only to the London 2012 Paralympic Games with 2.7m, while Ile-de-France Mobilites, the government authority operating the Paris\'92 public transport, expected to welcome up to 300,000 spectators a day, half as many as during the Olympic Games.\
The drop off in interest is not unexpected and it is fruitless to compare the Paralympics to the Olympics.\
The competitors certainly appreciated the crowds.\
\'93The French people have opened their hearts to us and to Paralympic sport,\'94 kayak silver medallist Emma Wiggs said to Olympic Information Service.\'a0International Paralympic Committee President Andrew Parsons\'a0\cf4 \cb3 \strokec5 told paralympic.org\cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 : \'93A combination of the sport performances, great venues, very smooth operations, but certainly the participation of the Parisians or the spectators in the stands made these Games so spectacular. \'91Merci beaucoup\'92 to the athletes, they were the big stars of the Games.\'94\
Fewer people attended the Paralympics. One family\'a0
\f1\i \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 The Athletic
\f0\i0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0interviewed were not interested in the Paralympics while an Uber driver was more enthusiastic about Paris Saint-Germain, Ligue 1\'92s TV rights and Manuel Ugarte\'92s move to Manchester United than the Games. \'93Casemiro,\'a0\cf4 \cb3 \strokec5 he\'92s ruined\cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 !\'94 he said.\
\'93We have to be honest,\'94 said Fouad Ben Ahmed, who works for Solution d\'92assistance mobilite verticale (SAMV), a local authority that offers mobility assistance services. \'93The Stade de France is not full, we\'92ve been offered tickets whereas for the Olympics we fought for tickets that were extremely expensive.\'94\
\'93It was great but the enthusiasm wasn\'92t as strong as the Olympics,\'94 said Gamze Kumcu. \'93There was less media coverage and I felt less caught up in the euphoria of the Paralympics.\'94\
\'93I\'92m a bit disappointed at the lack of interest in the Paralympics,\'94 added Adelia Paolillo, who noticed fewer people and media at the Club France fan zone.\
\'93It wasn\'92t the same craze for the Olympic Games but there were still a lot of people in the stands.\'94\
Ben Ahmed, who noted the lack of international visitors, thought the two-week gap between the Olympics and Paralympics was too big and dampened the enthusiasm of Parisians while many say \'91la rentree\'92 (the return to work and school after the summer holidays) on Monday, September 2 did not allow for people to get involved. Ben Ahmed also added he would have preferred an opening to the Olympic games and a closing of the Paralympics to send a message of inclusion.\
Despite that, he said the Games have been \'93magnificent, magical, a total success\'94.\
Mark Boucher, who showed coverage of both Games on TV in his restaurant, had less business for the Paralympics but that was to be expected given the return to work and school. He is just grateful more sport is on TV.\
\'93I prefer to watch the Olympics or the Paralympics because the news is not good in France \'97 politics and so on,\'94 said Boucher.\
\'93Once you see the Paralympic athletes doing what they have to do on TV, it makes you want to take part. It makes me happy. Us French need good news to put a smile on our faces. It\'92s a great atmosphere.\'94\
There is an irony to a city celebrating the success of hosting the Paralympics while being so poorly adapted to the people it is celebrating.\
In inner Paris, Pecresse said they have 100 per cent bus accessibility, but only 25 per cent on the rail network (metro, tram and RER trains). The 124-year-old metro is particularly problematic, with only two lines (11 and 14) accessible to people who have reduced mobility.\
Mike Olaye, who also works for SAMV, said it is \'93hell\'94 getting around the capital. \'93\'91There are stairs everywhere, there\'92s no help, the lifts and escalators are always out of order. They could do a lot better on that,\'94 he explained. Others said it was \'93impossible\'94.\
Patrick Gosselin, a wheelchair user who lives near Paris, gets around by car because of the ill-adapted transport, citing problems with \'93pavements, roads, cobblestones, walkways and spacing\'94.\
\'93You don\'92t see many disabled people in Paris because they can\'92t go out,\'94 said Muriel Lecamus, another wheelchair user, who lives in the suburbs and usually does not come to Paris because of the inaccessibility.\
Boucher, who went to the London Olympics in 2012, has a ramp for access in his restaurant but said he receives around five wheelchair users per year. \'93People don\'92t think about going out because they know it\'92s not well adapted. They are customers too, they\'92re people like us.\'94
